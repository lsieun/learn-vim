## Customizing vi

You can **change options** from within `vi` by using the `ex` command `:set`. 

> 在vi编辑器当中，可以使用`:set`命令改变vi的选项。这是第1种方法，通过直接修改命令；下面是第2种，修改配置文件。

In addition, whenever `vi` is started up, it reads a file in your **home directory** called `.exrc` for further operating instructions. By placing `:set` commands in this file, you can modify the way vi acts whenever you use it.

> 在home directory中的`.exrc`文件中可以设置`:set`命令。

You can also set up `.exrc` files in **local directories** to initialize various options that you
want to use in different environments. For example, you might define one set of options
for editing English text, but another set for editing source programs. 

> 你也可以在local directory中添加`.exrc`文件

The `.exrc` file in your **home directory** will be executed first, and then **the one in your current directory**.

### The `:set` Command

There are **two types of options** that can be changed with the `:set` command: 

- **toggle options**, which are either on or off, and 
- **options** that take a numeric or string value (such as the location of a margin or the name of a file).

> `:set`有两种类型的options：一种是toggle option，另一种是 value option。


**Toggle options** may be `on` or `off` by default.

```
:set option    # To turn a toggle option on
:set nooption  # To turn a toggle option off

:set ic        # to specify that pattern searches should ignore case
:set noic      # to return to being case-sensitive in searches
```

**Some options** have a `value` assigned to them. For example, the `window` option sets the number of lines shown in the screen’s “window.” You set values for these options with an equals sign (`=`):

```
:set window=20
```

During a vi session, you can check which options vi is using. 

```
:set all        # displays the complete list of options, 
                # including options that you have set and defaults that vi has “chosen.”

:set option?    #  find  out  the  current  value  of  any  individual  option  by  name

:set            # shows options that you have specifically changed, or set, 
                # either in your .exrc file or during the current session.
```

### The `.exrc` File

The `.exrc` file that controls your own vi environment is in your home directory. If you don’t yet have an `.exrc` file, simply use `vi` to create one.

Enter into this file the `set`, `ab`, and `map` commands that you want to have in effect whenever you use `vi` or `ex`. A sample `.exrc` file might look like this:

```txt
set nowrapscan wrapmargin=7
set sections=SeAhBhChDh nomesg
map q :w^M:n^M
map v dwElp
ab ORA O'Reilly Media, Inc.
```

## Executing Unix Commands

You can display or read in the results of **any Unix command** while you are editing in `vi`. **An exclamation mark** (`!`) tells ex to create a shell and to regard what follows as a Unix command:  

```
:!command

:!date    #  if you are editing and you want to check the time or date without exiting vi
:r !date  #  read the results of a Unix command into your file
```

If you want to give **several Unix commands in a row** without returning to `vi` editing in between, you can create a shell with the ex command:
```
:sh
```
When you want to **exit the shell** and return to `vi`, press `CTRL-D`.

You can also send **a block of text** as **standard input** to **a Unix command**. **The output** from this command replaces **the block of text in the buffer**.

```
:96,99!sort    # pass lines 96 through 99 through the sort filter and replace those lines with the output of sort.
```

## Saving Commands

Often you type the same long phrases over and over in a file. `vi` and `ex` have a number of different ways of saving long sequences of commands, both in **command mode** and in **insert mode**.

### Word Abbreviation

You can define **abbreviations** that vi will automatically expand into **the full text** whenever you type the abbreviation in insert mode.

```
:ab abbr phrase    # To define an abbreviation
:unab abbr         # disable the abbreviation
:ab                # To list your currently defined abbreviations

:ab imrc International Materials Research Center
```

### Using the map Command

While you’re editing, you may find that you are using **a command sequence frequently**, or that you occasionally use a very complex command sequence. To save yourself key-strokes, or the time that it takes to remember the sequence, you can assign **the sequence** to **an unused key** by using the `map` command.


```
:map x sequence    # Define character x as a sequence of editing commands.
:unmap x           # Disable the sequence defined for x.
:map               # List the characters that are currently mapped.
```
