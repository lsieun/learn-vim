# Saving Commands

Often you type the same long phrases over and over in a file. `vi` and `ex` have a number of different ways of saving long sequences of commands, both in **command mode** and in **insert mode**.

## Word Abbreviation

You can define **abbreviations** that vi will automatically expand into **the full text** whenever you type the abbreviation in insert mode.

```vim
:ab abbr phrase    # To define an abbreviation
:unab abbr         # disable the abbreviation
:ab                # To list your currently defined abbreviations

:ab imrc International Materials Research Center
```

## Using the map Command

While youâ€™re editing, you may find that you are using **a command sequence frequently**, or that you occasionally use a very complex command sequence. To save yourself key-strokes, or the time that it takes to remember the sequence, you can assign **the sequence** to **an unused key** by using the `map` command.

```vim
:map x sequence    # Define character x as a sequence of editing commands.
:unmap x           # Disable the sequence defined for x.
:map               # List the characters that are currently mapped.
```
