# Vim: Staying on Home Row via Map

原文地址：https://dockyard.com/blog/2013/09/11/vim-staying-on-home-row-via-map

## Vanilla Vim: Escaping and Saving

Escaping out to **Normal mode** from the other modes in Vim is straightforward: simply hit the `Esc` key. Saving files is accomplished by, from **Normal mode**, pressing `:w` and then `Enter`.

## So… What’s the Problem?

During a session, especially when I’m writing large pieces of text, I’d find myself in a repetitive rut:

- I just typed out a couple of sentences and want to save my progress
- I’d remove my left hand from home row to hit the `Esc` key
- Saving the file required me, once again to leave home row, to hit `:w` and then the Enter or the Return key
- To continue on, I’d press `i` and type along
- Repeat, repeat, repeat…

See where I’m getting at?

## Let’s Talk About Map

Before we review and copy-paste the portion of my `.vimrc`, let’s briefly go over the very basics of the pertinent `map` commands. You can find the entire `map` documentation [here](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/map.html) or by typing `:help map` within a Vim session.

Protip: To open help texts into a full buffer, `:h map | only` or to open them in a separate tab `:tab h map`.

### RECURSIVE MAP

First, we’re going to talk about **recursive map commands**. A recursive command will transform one result to another result, if there is another binding to that key. An example can be found at the `.vimrc` below.

Here are the basic recursive map commands.

- `map` - command to transform the operation of typed keys within ALL modes

You can prepend the first letter of the desired mode to map.

- `nmap` - transform the operation of typed keys within Normal mode
- `imap` - transform the operations of typed keys within Insert mode
- `vmap` - transform the operations of typed keys within Visual and Select mode

For example, if I had this within my `.vimrc`:

```vim
" ~/.vimrc
"
" Note: double quotes signifies comments
nmap 0 gg
imap n N

" Time for a little recursive map
imap d D
imap D wat
```

Since `0` is mapped to `gg` within **Normal mode**, I’ll be sent to the top of the file by pressing `0`. Moreover, while in **Insert mode**, every character `n` that I type will turn into `N`. Lastly, because of the **recursive mapping**, typing `d` in **Insert mode** will return `wat`. You can think of it as something like: `d => D => wat`.

Thankfully, there’s a **non-recursive map**.

### NON-RECURSIVE MAP

**Non-recursive map** commands are signified by adding `nore` after **the mode modifier**.

- `nnoremap` - non-recursive map for **Normal** mode
- `inoremap` - non-recursive map for **Insert** mode
- `vnoremap` - non-recursive map for **Visual** and **Select** mode

```vim
" ~/.vimrc

inoremap c C
inoremap C nope
```

Now, in **Insert mode**, if we type `c`, we will return `C`; the transformation of `c` to `nope` will not occur.

## Enter the `.vimrc`

Now that we got the basics out of the way, here is an example of my `.vimrc`.

```vim
" ~/.vimrc
" *** The Two Hand system ***
"
" <Cr> signifies the "return" key

inoremap ;a <Esc>
inoremap ;d <Esc>:update<Cr>
inoremap ;f <C-O>:update<Cr>
nnoremap ;f :update<CR>
```

I’m using `:update` here, which is “like `:write`, but only write when the buffer has been modified.”

Let’s go over these mappings.

The first one, `inoremap ;a <Esc>` maps **the semi-colon** and `a` key together when in **Insert mode**. By pressing `;` and then `a` immediately afterwards, we mimic the functionality of the `Escape` key.

The second map, `inoremap ;d <Esc>:update<Cr>` maps **the semi-colon** and the `d` key. Pressing `;` and then `d` immediately afterwards returns the sequence of:

- From **Insert mode**, escape to **Normal mode**
- Type `:` to get inside the Command mode, and type the `update` command
- Complete the sequence by “hitting” Return, thus saving the file

The third map command, `inoremap ;f <C-O>:update<Cr>`, allows us to type `;` and then `f` to return:

- From **Insert mode**, escape out to **Normal** with `<C-O>`, which allows us to escape out for ONE command.
- Type `:` to get inside **Command mode**, and then type `udpate`. This is our one command for `<C-O>`
- “Hit” the Return, thus saving the file
- We’re back in **Insert mode**, thanks to `<C-O>`

Finally, the `nnoremap ;f :update<CR>` mapping means by typing `;` and then `f` in **Normal mode**, it will result in:

- Since, we’re already in **Normal mode**, we get into **Command mode** by typing `:`
- Type the `update` command
- “Hit” the Return key, and save the file
- We remain in **Normal mode**

The snippet below restricts these commands to **your right hand**.

```vim
" ~/.vimrc
" *** The Right Hand system ***

inoremap ;l <Esc>
inoremap ;k <Esc>:update<Cr>
inoremap ;j <C-O>:update<Cr>
nnoremap ;j :update<CR>
```

As you can see, I kept `;` as a prefix to my `map` commands. This conveniently keeps me at homerow. I’ve played with mapping everything with my right hand, but it just didn’t feel “right” (apologies for the bad pun).

Overall, this snippet makes me happy and I believe this will make your day as well. If there are some other tricks concerning escaping and saving files, please let me know! Thanks!
