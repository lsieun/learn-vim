# tab

A `tab` in Vim is a collection of one or more `window`s. The best way to think of `tab`s, therefore, is as enabling you to group windows usefully. For example, if you were working on code for both a client program and a server program, you could have the files for the client program open in the first tab, perhaps in three or four windows, and the files for the server program open in another, which could be, say, seven windows. You can then flick back and forth between the tabs using `:tabn` and `:tabp`.
