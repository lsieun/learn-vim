# window

A `window` is a `viewport` on a `buffer`.

When you open a new window with `:split` or `:vsplit`, you can include a filename in the call. This opens the file in a new buffer, and then opens a new `window` as a `view` onto it. A `buffer` can be viewed in multiple windows within a single Vim session; you could have a hundred windows editing the same buffer if you wanted to.

In vim to manage windows it is `CTRL`+`w` the leading command, that you can follow with several options:

打开窗口：

- `CTRL`+`w`, `s`: Opens a new honrizontal split
- `CTRL`+`w`, `v`: Opens a new vertical split

我有一个疑问：`:split`和`:vsplit`是上面这两个快捷键会有差异吗？

关闭窗口：

- `CTRL`+`w`, `c`: Closes a window but keeps the buffer. Same as `：close`
- `CTRL`+`w`, `o`: Closes other windows, keeps the active window only
- `CTRL-W CTRL-O`: Make the current window the only one on the screen.
