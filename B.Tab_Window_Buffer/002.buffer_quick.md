## 1. Basic Intro

添加缓冲区

```vim
:badd <filename>
```

删除缓冲区

```vim
:bd
:bdelete
```

查看buffer list

```vim
:ls
```

切换buffer

```vim
:bn   # 切换到下一个buffer
:bp   # 切换到上一个buffer
:b<n> # 切换到第n个buffer
```

## 2. Remapping Buffer Commands

Here are some key remappings that speed up buffer movement:

```vim
" ~/.vimrc (or wherever else you keep your .vimrc)

" Move to the previous buffer with "gp"
nnoremap gp :bp<CR>

" Move to the next buffer with "gn"
nnoremap gn :bn<CR>

" List all possible buffers with "gl"
nnoremap gl :ls<CR>

" List all possible buffers with "gb" and accept a new buffer argument [1]
nnoremap gb :ls<CR>:b
```

Note: Remapping `gp` will remove the Vim default functionality of `gp`. Use `:h gp` to read more about it.

- `gp` = go to previous
- `gn` = go to next
- `gl` = go to list
- `gb` = go to buffer N
