# eclim

If you plan on using `eclim` without the eclipse gui, then:

- start the eclimd server.

To start `eclimd`, simply execute the `eclimd` script found in your **eclipse root directory** (or the path specified at the end of the command line installer):

```bash
$ $ECLIPSE_HOME/eclimd
```

Once you have the eclim daemon (headed or headless) running, you can then test eclim:

- open a `vim` window and issue the command, `:PingEclim`. The result of executing this command should be **the eclim and eclipse version** echoed to the bottom of your Vim window.

```txt
eclim   2.8.0
eclipse 4.8.0
Press ENTER or type command to continue
```
