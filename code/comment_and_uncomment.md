# comment and uncomment

## To comment out blocks in vim:

- press `Esc` (to leave editing or other mode)
- hit `ctrl+v` (visual block mode)
- use the up/down arrow keys to select lines you want (it won't highlight everything - it's OK!)
- `Shift+i` (capital I)
- insert the text you want, i.e. %
- press `EscEsc` (这里是两个ESC哟！！！))

## To uncomment blocks in vim:

- press `Esc` (to leave editing or other mode)
- hit `ctrl+v` (visual block mode)
- use the `↑/↓` arrow keys to select the lines to uncomment.
- If you want to select multiple characters, use one or combine these methods:
    - use the `left/right` arrow keys to select more text
    - to select chunks of text use `shift` + `←/→` arrow key
    - you can repeatedly push the delete keys below, like a regular delete button
- press `d` or `x` to delete characters, repeatedly if necessary
