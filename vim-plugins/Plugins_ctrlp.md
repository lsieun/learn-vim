## Basic Usage

### Before CtrlP is open:

- Run `:CtrlP` or `:CtrlP [starting-directory]` to invoke CtrlP in find **file mode**.
- Run `:CtrlPBuffer` or `:CtrlPMRU` to invoke CtrlP in find **buffer** or find **MRU file mode**.
- Run `:CtrlPMixed` to search in **Files**, **Buffers** and **MRU files** at the same time.

Check `:help ctrlp-commands` and `:help ctrlp-extensions` for other commands.

### Once CtrlP is open:

- Use `<c-j>`, `<c-k>` or the arrow keys to navigate the result list.
- Use `<c-t>` or `<c-v>`, `<c-x>` to open the selected entry in a new tab or in a new split.
