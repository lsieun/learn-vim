## Buffers

**A buffer** in Vim is probably best thought of for most users as **an open instance of a file**, that may not necessarily be visible on the current screen. 


## Windows

**A window** in Vim is **a viewport** onto **a single buffer**. 


## Tabs

Finally, **a tab** in Vim is a collection of one or more **windows**.
