# Vim 101: runtimepath

URL: https://medium.com/usevim/vim-101-runtimepath-83194d411b0a

Vim looks for scripts and documentation in various directories, both in your home directory and system-wide. This is controlled by the '`runtimepath`' option.

Depending on your system, the '`runtimepath`' option will be set to several paths, separated by **commas**. Typing `:set runtimepath?` will display it. At the end of this list should be some '`after`' directories:

```txt
runtimepath=
~/.vim,
/var/lib/vim/addons,
/usr/share/vim/vimfiles,
/usr/share/vim/vim72,
/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/after,
/var/lib/vim/addons/after,
~/.vim/after
```

Typing `:help 'rtp'` will show documentation that includes a list of every type of file that Vim searches for, as well as the standard locations.

There is also a `:runtime` command, which will load files (like plugins) based on the '`runtimepath`'.

Finally, there’s also `$VIMRUNTIME`. This is used to locate the documentation and plugins that ship with Vim. It's not actually necessary to define it in your shell -- Vim has a default and a strategy for figuring it out when necessary.

## Relationship to Pathogen and Vundle

If you use `Pathogen`, you may have noticed that the author refers to it as a '`runtimepath`' manager. There's a good reason for this: it modifies the '`runtimepath`' to include each directory within your "bundle" directory to make plugins easier to manage. If you're using `Pathogen` you'll see a lot of `~/.vim/bundle` directories when typing `:set runtimepath`.

Although `Vundle` works differently to Pathogen, it also manages **the runtime path of installed scripts**.

Most beginners discover `Pathogen` or `Vundle` and realise they make managing plugins easier, but don’t fully appreciate the relevance of '`runtimepath`' management. Now you should be able to understand a little bit about why this is useful.
