# Global Replacement

In a **global replacement**, the `ex` editor checks **each line of a file** for **a given pattern of characters**. On **all lines where the pattern is found**, `ex` replaces **the pattern** with **a new string of characters**. For right now, we’ll treat **the search pattern** as if it were **a simple string**; later in the chapter we’ll look at the powerful pattern-matching language known as **regular expressions**.

> search pattern，有两个阶段：第1阶段是simple string，第2阶段是regular expressions。

**Global replacement** really uses two `ex` commands: `:g` (global) and `:s` (substitute).

```vim
:help :g
```

## Context-Sensitive Replacement

There is **a slightly more complex syntax** for **global replacement**. This syntax lets you search for a `pattern`, and then, once you find the line with the `pattern`, make a substitution on a string different from the pattern. You can think of this as **context-sensitive replacement**.

The syntax is as follows:

```vim
:g/pattern/s/old/new/g
```

The first `g` tells the command to operate on **all lines of a file**. `pattern` identifies the lines on which a substitution is to take place. On those lines containing `pattern`, `ex` is to substitute (`s`) for **old** the characters in **new**. The last `g` indicates that the substitution is to occur globally on that line.

## Pattern-Matching Rules

Note that **regular expressions** can be used with the `vi` search commands `/` and `?`, as well as in the `ex` commands `:g` and `:s`.

**Regular expressions** are made up by combining **normal characters** with **a number of special characters** called **metacharacters**.

## Metacharacters Used in Search Patterns

| Metacharacter | Meaning |
|:-------------:|---------|
| `.` | Matches any single character except **a newline**. <br/>Remember that **spaces** are treated as characters. |
| `*` | Matches zero or more (as many as there are) of the single character that immediately precedes it. <br/>  `.*` means “match any number of any character.” <br/> `:s/End.*/End/` removes all characters after **End** |
| `^` | When used **at the start of a regular expression**, requires that the following regular expression  be  found  at  the  beginning  of  the  line. <br/> When **not at the beginning of a regular expression**, `^` stands for itself.|
| `$` | When used **at the end of a regular expression**, requires that the preceding regular expression be found at the end of the line; <br/> When **not at the end of a regular expression**, `$` stands for itself. |
| `\` | Treats the following special character as an ordinary character. <br/> `\.` matches an actual period instead of “any single character” <br/> `\*` matches an actual asterisk instead of “any number of a character” <br/> The `\` (backslash) prevents the interpretation of a special character. This prevention is called “**escaping the character**.” (Use `\\` to get a literal backslash.) |
| `[]` | Matches any one of the characters enclosed between the brackets. <br/> `[AB]`matches either A or B <br/>  `p[aeiou]t` matches pat, pet, pit, pot, or put <br/> **A range of consecutive characters** can be specified by separating **the first** and **last characters** in the range with a hyphen. <br/>  `[A-Z]` will match any uppercase letter from A to Z <br/> `[0-9]` will match any digit from 0 to 9. <br/>  `[:;A-Za-z()]` will match four different punctuation marks, plus all letters. <br/>**Most metacharacters** lose their special meaning inside brackets, so you don’t need to escape them if you want to use them as ordinary characters. <br/> Within brackets, **the three metacharacters** you still need to escape are `\-]`. <br/> The hyphen (`-`) acquires meaning as a range specifier; to use an actual hyphen, you can also place it as the first character inside the brackets. <br/> A caret (`^`) has special meaning only when it is **the first character** inside the brackets, but in this case the meaning differs from that of the normal `^` metacharacter. As **the first character within brackets**, a `^` reverses their sense: the brackets will match any one character not in the list. For example, `[^0-9]` matches any character that is not a digit.|
| `\( \)` | Saves the pattern enclosed between `\(` and `\)` into a special holding space, or a “hold buffer.” Up to **nine** patterns can be saved in this way on a single line. <br/> `\(That\) or \(this\)` saves **That** in hold **buffer number 1** and saves **this** in hold **buffer number 2**. <br/> `:%s/\(That\) or \(this\)/\2 or \1/`  to rephrase **That or this** to read **this or That** <br/> You can also use the \n notation within a search or substitute string. <br/> `:s/\(abcd\)\1/alphabet-soup/` changes **abcdabcd** into **alphabet-soup**. |
| `\< \>` | Matches characters at the beginning (`\<`) or at the end (`\>`) of a word. **The end or beginning of a word** is determined either by **a punctuation mark** or by **a space**<br/> `\<ac` will match only words that begin with *ac*, such as *action*. <br/> `ac\>` will match only words that end with *ac*, such as *maniac*. <br/> Note that unlike `\(...\)`, these do not have to be used in matched pairs. |
| `~` | Matches whatever regular expression was used in the last search.  <br/>  For example, if you searched for **The**, you could search for **Then** with `/~n`. <br/>Note that you can use this pattern only in a regular search (with `/`). It won’t work as the pattern in a substitute command. It does, however, have a similar meaning in the **replacement portion** of a substitute command. <br/>这个我没有搞清楚，好像它也是不推荐使用的。 |

All **pattern searches** are **case-sensitive**. You can also instruct `vi` to ignore case by typing `:set ic`. 

> 注意： search pattern部分是区分大小写的

When you make **global replacements**, **the regular expression metacharacters** carry their special meanings only within **the search portion** (**the first part**) of **the
command**.

> 注意：上面的metacharacters，只在global replacement中的search portion起作用。下面介绍在replacement portion中使用的metacharacters。

## Metacharacters Used in Replacement Strings

| Metacharacter | Meaning |
|:-------------:|---------|
| `\n` | Is replaced with the text matched by the **n**th pattern previously saved by `\(` and `\)`, where `n` is a number from `1` to `9`, and previously saved patterns (kept in hold buffers) are counted from the left on the line.  |
| `\` | Treats the following special character as an ordinary character. **Backslashes** are **metacharacters** in **replacement strings** as well as in **search patterns**. To specify **a real backslash**, type two in a row (`\\`). |
| `&` | Is replaced with **the entire text** matched by **the search pattern** when used in a **replacement string**. <br/> `:%s/Yazstremski/&, Carl/` The replacement will say *Yazstremski, Carl* <br/> The `&` can also replace **a variable pattern** (as specified by a regular expression). <br/> `:1,10s/.*/(&)/`  surround each line from 1 to 10 with parentheses|
| `\u or \l` | Causes the next character in the replacement string to be changed to **uppercase** or **lowercase**, respectively. <br/> `:%s/yes, doctor/\uyes, \udoctor/`  change "yes, doctor" into "Yes, Doctor" <br/> `:%s/\(That\) or \(this\)/\2 or \1/` The result is "this or That", but we need to adjust the cases. <br/> `:s/\(That\) or \(this\)/\u\2 or \l\1/` The result is "This or that". |
| `\U` or `\L` and `\e` or `\E` | `\U` and `\L` are similar to `\u` or `\l`, but **all following characters are converted to uppercase or lowercase** until the end of the replacement string or until `\e` or `\E` is reached. If there is no `\e` or `\E`, all characters of the replacement text are affected by the `\U` or `\L`. <br/> `:%s/Fortran/\UFortran/` to uppercase *Fortran* <br/> `:%s/Fortran/\U&/` using the `&` character to repeat the search string
