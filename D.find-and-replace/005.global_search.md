# Global Searches

`ex` has a **global command**, `g`, that lets you **search for a pattern** and **display all lines containing the pattern** when it finds them. The command `:g!` does the opposite of `:g`. Use `:g!` (or its synonym, `:v`) to search for all lines that do not contain pattern.

You can use **the global command** on **all lines in the file**, or you can use **line addresses** to limit a global search to specified lines or to a range of lines.

```vim
:g/pattern     # Finds (moves to) the last occurrence of pattern in the file.
:g/pattern/p   # Finds and displays all lines in the file containing pattern.
:g!/pattern/nu         # Finds and displays all lines in the file that don’t contain pattern; also displays the line number for each line found.
:60,124g/pattern/p     # Finds and displays any lines between lines 60 and 124 containing pattern.
```

As you might expect, `g` can also be used for **global replacements**.
