```vim
:help :s
```

## 1. the first in one line

The **substitute** command has the syntax:

```vim
:s/old/new/
```

This changes the **first** occurrence of the pattern **old** to **new** on **the current line**. The `/` (**slash**) is the delimiter between the various parts of the command. (The **slash** is optional when it is the last character on the line.)

## 2. all in one line

A **substitute** command with the syntax:

```vim
:s/old/new/g
```

changes **every** occurrence of **old** to **new** on **the current line**, not just the first occurrence. The `:s` command allows **options** following **the substitution string**. The `g` option in the syntax above stands for **global**. (The `g` option affects **each pattern on a line**; don’t confuse it with the `:g` command, which affects **each line of a file**.)

## 3. all in multiple line

By prefixing the `:s` command with **addresses**, you can extend its range to more than one line.

```vim
:50,100s/old/new/g   # change every occurrence of old to new from line 50 to line 100
:1,$s/old/new/g      # change every occurrence of old to new within the entire file
:%s/old/new/g        # You can also use `%` instead of `1,$` to specify every line in a file.
```

## 4. Confirming Substitutions

add the `c` option (for confirm) at the end of the **substitute** command:

```vim
:1,30s/his/the/gc
```

## 5. More Substitution Tricks

A simple `:s` is the same as `:s//~/`. In other words, **repeat the last substitution**. This can save enormous amounts of time and typing when you are working your way through a document making the same change repeatedly but you don’t want to use a global substitution.

> `:s` 重复上一次替换

The `&` key can be used as a `vi` command to perform the `:&` command, i.e., to repeat the last substitution. This can save even more typing than `:s`  ENTER—one key-stroke versus three.
