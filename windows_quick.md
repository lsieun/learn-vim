A `window` is a `viewport` on a `buffer`. 

In vim to manage windows it is `CTRL`+`w` the leading command, that you can follow with several options:

打开窗口：

- `CTRL`+`w`, `s`: Opens a new honrizontal split
- `CTRL`+`w`, `v`: Opens a new vertical split

关闭窗口：

- `CTRL`+`w`, `c`: Closes a window but keeps the buffer. Same as `：close`
- `CTRL`+`w`, `o`: Closes other windows, keeps the active window only
- `CTRL-W CTRL-O`: Make the current window the only one on the screen.
